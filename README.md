# firebase-ruby-playground

A ruby playground to experiment with the ruby wrapper for the FIrebase API.

## Installation

Pull the repository down and run `bundle install` to get all the dependencies. If you don't have `bundle`, run `gem install bundler`. This project uses Ruby 2.6.x.

## Running

First, you're going to need a firebase account and a firestore created for this repository. You're then going to want to create a file called `.env` in the project root that will store the firesbase project ID. The format of the .env file is below.

```
PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_google_creds_json_file>
```

The path for the second key there, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, can be obtained by following the the "Firestore Ruby Getting Started" article that's linked in the references.

To start the playground, just run `bundle exec rake play` or if you have rake installed, run `rake play`.

## Other commands

There are other `rake` commands that you can run in this project, they are documented in the table below. You can run any of the commands listed below using `rake <command>`.

| Command         | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `play`          | the main command that runs the playground code                            |
| `pry`           | includes all the code but launches into `pry` instead of running the code |
| `rubocop`       | runs rubocop on the entire project and autocorrects whatever it can       |
| `spec`          | runs the RSpec tests that are in the project with coverage                |
| `test`          | an alias for `spec`                                                       |
| `open_coverage` | open's the coverage file generated by `simplecov`                         |

Just running `rake` or `bundle exec rake` will run the `spec` and `rubocop` tasks.
